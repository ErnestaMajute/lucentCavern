## Design

### Theme

I wanted to create a website that would create a feeling that you are in a lucent cavern. Main image on a home page is a base for all website's colours and backgrounds. Main goal of light colours is to provide lightweight and modern site.

### Colours

Colours taken from home image, to match whole website.

### Typography

Main font family is  [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) from Google Fonts.

## Wireframes
Wireframes were created by hand. They look simple and not very detailed, a bit different from final look because they were created before I started my project. Personally for me it's easier to put everything into places when project is in progress already, details like buttons forms and other elements.
